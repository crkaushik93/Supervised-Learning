# Supervised-Learning

The real-world applications, strengths and weaknesses of the models been chose! It seems that the project had a very good understanding of the models.

It is always good to write a function like train_predict which can be called from other modules with different samples of train and test data. 
It makes the code cleaner, organised and easy to debug.

Training the models with different sample sizes and getting the predictions on test set! 
Good use of random seeds! Nice visualizations to compare the performances of the models!

Good discussion on Random Forest. A description about how decision trees are trained and how they are combined in a random forest to make way 
better predictions is provided.

Implementing Random Forest classifier to get feature importance!
